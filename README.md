[Codewars](http://www.codewars.com/r/J4C9eA) is a website with coding challenges, called katas, that allow you to focus on improving your coding skills and technique. Each kata on the site is set to a Kyu/Dan rank(8 Kyu being a Beginner level and 8 Dan being a Master level), based on its subject area and difficulty. You can find out more about Codewars [here](https://www.codewars.com/about).

Here are some [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/r/J4C9eA) katas that I have created.
